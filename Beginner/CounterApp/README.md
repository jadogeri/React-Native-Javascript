# COUNTER APP

## Description

My motivation for this project is to solve problems in javascript and build mobile applications for both ios and android. I built this project to utilize the basic concepts of javascript. This project updates user counts based on changed. This project taught me to write simple unit tests using jest testing library, read user inputs and import multiple modules.
